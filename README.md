# Student Feedback Survey Analysis ✅

**Short description:** A small Python project to load and analyze a student feedback survey CSV (sample: `student_feedback_sample_120.csv`) to produce summary statistics, visualizations, and insights.

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Recommended packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (add others as needed)

Tip: create a virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\Activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If there is no `requirements.txt`, install the packages manually: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy`

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the main script:

```powershell
# If `project.py` accepts a path argument
python project.py student_feedback_sample_120.csv

# Or just run
python project.py
```

Check the console output or generated files (e.g., `.csv`, `.png`) in the project folder for results.
